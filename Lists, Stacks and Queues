/* 
Lists are a group of objects that share characteristics that are grouped together in a variable, they can be linked or not, ordered or not
Linked Lists can be singly linked (connect to next item), doubly linked (connect to previous and next item) and circular linked (first and final item are connected)

Stack - A list of objects where the objects are removed and added from the top, last-in first-out (LIFO)
Stacks are dynamic structures since their size is constantly changing, stacks need a pointer to the last item in the stack
push(s, i) - adds item i to top of the stack s
pop(s) - remove top item from stack s

Queue - A list of objects where objects come from the side, first-in first-out (FIFO)
Queues are also dynamic structures due to constantly changing size, queues need two pointers, one for the first and one for the end of the queue
insert(q,x) - insert item x in queue q
x = remove(q) - removes item x from the queue q
empty(q) = returns whether the queue is empty or not
