Sorting Algorithms are used to arrange lists of items in a specified order.
Bubble Sort 
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort

Bubble Sort is used to exam the list item by item and replacing the first value with the smallest value, repeating until fully sorted.
May be inefficient in large lists due to constant looping needed.
- Iteration
- Comparison
- Exchange Positions

Insertion Sort moves the minimum value at the beggining of the list, one at a time.
Not suitable for large lists.

Selection Sort creates an ordered (empty at first) and unordered array (the list), then checks for the lowest item in the unordered array and puts it in the ordered one.
With each iteration selecting the now lowest item in the unordered array until it's empty.
Simple, and uses lower amounts of memory.
